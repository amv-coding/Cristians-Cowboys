         <h5>Emmitt Smith Synopsis of a True Legend of the Game:</h5>
         <p>Legendary NFL running Back, and your personal favorite player( the source of that information is classified,but his name does rhyme with Ryan). Emmitt Smith is the greatest running back to have ever played the game. His numbers alone substantially prove this point. He has the most career rushing yard, Rushing TD's, and with three superbowls to boot it truly is an unchallenged argument. In 2010 his first year of eligibility Emmitt became enshrined in the NFL Hall of Fame! Emmitt also achieved an even greater unprecedented feat of becoming a great Cowboy off the field as well.</p>

       <h5> Roger Staubach: The Emmaculate Embodiment of a True American, an Iconic Cowboy:</h5>
       <p> Roger Staubach was drafted in 1964, but as a true american he took part in a much more valued role, since he went to the U.S Naval Academy he was required to do service for our country. Thank you for your service Mr. Staubach it truly is a sacrifice that deserves all the recognition one could give! After completeing his service including a tour in Vietnam he started his NFL Career in 1969. Staubach ended up having an emmaculate career including a couple superbowls </p>
       <br>
       <p>
         Statistically speaking in comparison to the modern-day NFL, Staubachs stats are predestrian, but for his time was astounding. A major accomplishment was the fact that he helped the Cowboys win their first two superbowls, and thus establishing themselves as Americas team. After an impressive ten year career with two superbowls Staubach decided it would be best to retire.
       </p>
       <br>
       <P>
         Rogers off-field accomplishments are in a league of their own from amassing an incredible fortune in real estate to being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018. Staubach truly is the physical personification of "Captain America".
       </P>

         <p> There have been several documentaries, specials, memoirs, books, features, and so on that showcase the life of not only an Iconic Cowboy, but an Iconic figure in all of sports. Landrys life, and coaching career is truly unparalled in many ways. </p>
         <br>
         <p> One of the most innovative coaches in history including one of the most impactful innovations in football the making of the 4-3 Defense, which for decades was nearly unstoppable when properly executed. To fully represent all of Landrys innovations would be a seperate website all on it's own</p>
         <br>
         <p> Being that Landry is the longest-tenured coach in the history of the Cowboys, and the entire NFL; to properly summarize 28 years as a coach for an historic franchise would be a plethora of websites to properly do it justice </p>
         <br>
         <p> On February 12th, 2000 battling leukemia, Landry passed away in peace. Landry always dressed in his trademark fedora, and suite/tie, which is a far-cry from the modern-day NFL coaches today. He was known as a stoic, yet kind-hearted person who lead his men to success with stern passion, yet calm assertiveness that hasn't even been close to being replicated, and for that truly deserves all the respect in the world</p>

<h5> The Charismatic Cornerback like no other:</h5>
<p> Deion had a 5 year stint with Cowboys while shorter than the other legends on this list was incredible to say the least he even had an offensive touchdown with the boys.</p>
<br>
<p> Everywhere Deion went he had acheived greatness he did it with charisma and pure once-in-a-lifetime athleticism that has yet to truly be replicated. He has had major success in a plethora of endeavors including the MLB becoming the only person to play in a world series, and a superbowl, becoming a successful broadcaster, and even a successful high school coach</p>
<br>
<p>
  Deion had a mini comeback with the Ravens as nickel corner had a couple picks showing that even in his late 30's at the time that he can still play at a high level

        <h5> Michael Irvin the Wildest Cowboy there was:</h5>
        <p>
        Let me tell you something Michael Irvin out of all the Cowboys there ever was including even the Actual Cowboys from the 1800's is truly without a shadow of a doubt the wildest of em all hands down( no pun there, since Michael Irvin had a remarkable set of his hands)! An extremely polarizing figure, yet for the poeple who are big fans of him including me as a ravens fan ( he is a vastly underrated broadcaster really funny, and brings raw passion about football to make even the most mundane topics intriging) really gravitate toward the adversity he had to overcome to get to his level of success.
        From a football standpoint his on the field performance was truly impeccable, but during his career his off the field was, so beligerently wild that you would be surprised, and proud to see how he much has accomplished. His life has so many twists and turns that it would require a whole different website to feasible cover it all ( this is also out of respect in the odd likely hood that Michael Irvin stumbles upon this as relieving some parts of his life is probably something he'll like to do; so to proof a point, and keep things relatively light a brief list of these hurdles will be shown at the end). Speaking of covering, it was damn near impossible to cover Irvin in the 90's, slicing up the Cowboys recordbook like cake. Unfortunately there is major what ifs pertaining to Irvins career, since his career was cut short due to non-life threating spinal cord injury 
        </p>

        <p>
          To summarize  Michael Irvin: an amazing physically-gifted receiver, wild life of the field, changed his life for the better, and in my honest opinion while not shared by everyone is that he is the personifaction on how to overcome adversity, and truly make the most out of life.

        <li class="list-item"> Three-Time Superbowl Champion(XXVII, XXVIII, XXX) </li>
        <li class="list-item"> 2014 NFL Executive of the Year</li>
        <li class="list-item"> Owner of the Cowboys for 30+ years </li>
        <li class="list-item"> Turned the Cowboys into a Multi-Billion dollar Franchise </li>
        <li class="list-item">  2017 NFL Hame of Fame Inductee </li>
        </ul>
        <h5> The Most Notable Legendary Owner of Americas Team</h5>
        <p> While not exactly the most liked Cowboy, especially after the fact the day after he bought ownership of the Cowboys he terminated the legendary Cowboys Coach Tom Landry, which immediately vilified him to the masses, and took him many years to even slightly alter this perception of himself </p>
        <br>
        <p> Overall, whether you like him or not; his contributions for the Cowboys have catapulted the franchise to truly unfathomable levels of success. His contributions helped form a dynasty in the 90's that has really only been replicated by those patriotic folks up north in New England. Anyways on that note, I also will like to acknowledge the fact that he is also the most recognizable owner, and figures of the NFL(there a couple other people who match his prominence, but for the most part you can ask the most casual football fan, who is Jerry Jones?, and they'll be able to tell you easily thats how prominent he is).</p>
